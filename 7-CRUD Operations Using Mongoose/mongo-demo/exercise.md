# Exercises

## Exercise 1

I want you to write a program, and get all the published backend courses in our new database, sort them by their name, and pick only their *name* and *author* properties. So that means you should start from scratch. You need to load the *Mongoose* module, you need to connect to our new *MongoDB* database, you need to create a schema to define the shape of documents in our *courses* collection, and eventually write a query.

## Exercise 2

Get all the published frontend and backend courses, sort the by their price in descendind order, from most expensive to least expensive, pick only their name and author, and display them on the console.
