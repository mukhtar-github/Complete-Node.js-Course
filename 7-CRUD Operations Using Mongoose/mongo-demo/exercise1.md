# Exercise

## Exercise 1

I want you to write a program, and get all the published backend courses in our new database, sort them by their name, and pick only their *name* and *author* properties. So that means you should start from scratch. You need to load the *Mongoose* module, you need to connect to our new *MongoDB* database, you need to create a schema to define the shape of documents in our *courses* collection, and eventually write a query.
