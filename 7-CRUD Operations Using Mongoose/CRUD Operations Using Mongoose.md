# CRUD Operations Using Mongoose

## 1- Introducing MongoDB

Alright, so back to our *Vidly Application*, so far we have stored the list of genres in an array in memory. That's not how we build real world applications. Because when the server restarts, we're going to lose all the data and memory. So, that's why we need to store our data in a database. Now as I told you before, when building applications with *Node* and *Express*, you have a large number of options in terms of the database you want to use. In this course we're going to use *MongoDB*, because that's a very popular database management system, and it's quite often used in applications build with *Node* and *Express*. So if you have never worked with *MongoDB* before, don't worry, you're going to learn about it bit by bit over the next few sections.
