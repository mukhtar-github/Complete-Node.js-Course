// 2 - Package.json

//Before you add any Node packages to your application, you need to create a file that is called package.json
//Package.json is basically a json file that includes some basic information about your application or your
//project, such as it's name, it's version, it's authors and so on. It's basically a bunch of metadata about your
//application. And all Node applications by standard have this package.json file. Moreover, before adding any node 
//packages to your application, you need to create a package.json file. So, as a best practice whenever you start
//a Node project, you need to run npm-init to create package.json. The faster way to create a package.json file is
//to supply the flag npm init --yes.
